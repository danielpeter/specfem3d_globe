Notes and Acknowledgements
==========================

In order to keep the software package thread-safe in case a multithreaded implementation of MPI is used, developers should not add modules or common blocks to the source code but rather use regular subroutine arguments (which can be grouped in “derived types” if needed for clarity).

The Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre subroutines in `gll_library.f90` are based in part on software libraries from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA). The non-structured global numbering software was provided by Paul F. Fischer (Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA, now at Argonne National Laboratory, USA).

[OpenDX](http://www.opendx.org) is open-source based on IBM Data Explorer, [AVS](http://www.avs.com) is a trademark of Advanced Visualization Systems, and [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org) is an open-source visualization platform.

Please provide your feedback, questions, comments, and suggestions through the github repository.

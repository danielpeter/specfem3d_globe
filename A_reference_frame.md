Reference Frame Convention
==========================

The code uses the following convention for the Cartesian reference frame:

-   the \(x\) axis points East

-   the \(y\) axis points North

-   the \(z\) axis points up

Note that this convention is different from both the Aki and Richards (1980) convention and the Harvard Centroid-Moment Tensor (CMT) convention. The Aki & Richards convention is

-   the \(x\) axis points North

-   the \(y\) axis points East

-   the \(z\) axis points down

and the Harvard CMT convention is

-   the \(x\) axis points South

-   the \(y\) axis points East

-   the \(z\) axis points up

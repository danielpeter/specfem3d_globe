SAC Headers
===========

Information about the simulation (i.e., event/station information, sampling rate, etc.) is written in the header of the seismograms in SAC format. The list of values and related explanation are given in Figure [fig:SAC-headers]. Please check the SAC webpages for further information. Please note that the reference time KZTIME is the centroid time (\(t_\text{CMT}=t_\text{PDE}+\texttt{time shift}\)) which corresponds to zero time in the synthetics. For kinematic rupture simulations, KZTIME is equal to the CMT time of the source having the minimum time-shift in the `CMTSOLUTION` file, and coordinates, depth and half-duration of the event are not provided in the headers.

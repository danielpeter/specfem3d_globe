Running the Solver `xspecfem3D`
===============================

Now that you have successfully run the mesher, you are ready to compile the solver. For reasons of speed, the solver uses static memory allocation. Therefore it needs to be recompiled (type ‘`make clean`’ and ‘`make specfem3D`’) every time one reruns the mesher with different parameters. To compile the solver one needs a file generated by the mesher in the directory `OUTPUT_FILES` called `values_from_mesher.h`, which contains parameters describing the static size of the arrays as well as the setting of certain flags.

The solver needs three input files in the `DATA` directory to run: the `Par_file` that was discussed in detail in Chapter [cha:Running-the-Mesher], the earthquake source parameter file `CMTSOLUTION` or the force source parameter file <span>`FORCESOLUTION`</span>, and the stations file `STATIONS`. Most parameters in the `Par_file` should be set prior to running the mesher. Only the following parameters may be changed after running the mesher:

-   the simulation type control parameters: `SIMULATION_TYPE` and `SAVE_FORWARD`

-   the record length `RECORD_LENGTH_IN_MINUTES`

-   the movie control parameters `MOVIE_SURFACE`, `MOVIE_VOLUME`, and `NTSTEPS_BETWEEN_FRAMES`

-   the multi-stage simulation parameters `NUMBER_OF_RUNS` and `NUMBER_OF_THIS_RUN`

-   the output information parameters `NTSTEP_BETWEEN_OUTPUT_INFO`, `NTSTEP_BETWEEN_OUTPUT_SEISMOS`, `OUTPUT_SEISMOS_ASCII_TEXT`, `OUTPUT_SEISMOS_SAC_ALPHANUM`, `OUTPUT_SEISMOS_SAC_BINARY` and `ROTATE_SEISMOGRAMS_RT`

-   the `RECEIVERS_CAN_BE_BURIED` and `PRINT_SOURCE_TIME_FUNCTION` flags

Any other change to the `Par_file` implies rerunning both the mesher and the solver.

For any particular earthquake, the `CMTSOLUTION` file that represents the point source may be obtained directly from the Harvard Centroid-Moment Tensor (CMT) web page . It looks like this:

The top line is the initial estimate of the source, which is used as a starting point for the CMT solution. **M** is the moment tensor, \(M_{0}\)<span> </span>is the seismic moment, and \(M_{w}\) is the moment magnitude.<span data-label="fig:CMTSOLUTION-file"></span>](figures/Denali_CMT.pdf "fig:") <div class="figcaption" style="text-align:justify;font-size:80%"><span style="color:#9A9A9A">Figure: `CMTSOLUTION` file obtained from the Harvard CMT catalog.

The `CMTSOLUTION` should be edited in the following way:

-   For point-source simulations (see finite sources, page ) we recommend setting the source half-duration parameter `half duration` equal to zero, which corresponds to simulating a step source-time function, i.e., a moment-rate function that is a delta function. If `half duration` is not set to zero, the code will use a Gaussian (i.e., a signal with a shape similar to a ‘smoothed triangle’, as explained in Komatitsch and Tromp (2002) and shown in Fig [fig:gauss.vs.triangle]) source-time function with half-width `half duration`. We prefer to run the solver with `half duration` set to zero and convolve the resulting synthetic seismograms in post-processing after the run, because this way it is easy to use a variety of source-time functions (see Section [sec:Process-data-and-syn]). Komatitsch and Tromp (2002) determined that the noise generated in the simulation by using a step source time function may be safely filtered out afterward based upon a convolution with the desired source time function and/or low-pass filtering. Use the postprocessing script `process_syn.pl` (see Section [sub:process<sub>s</sub>yn.pl]) with the `-h` flag, or the serial code `convolve_source_timefunction.f90` and the script `utils/convolve_source_timefunction.csh` for this purpose, or alternatively use signal-processing software packages such as SAC . Type

        make convolve_source_timefunction

    to compile the code and then set the parameter `hdur` in `utils/convolve_source_timefunction.csh` to the desired half-duration.

-   The zero time of the simulation corresponds to the center of the triangle/Gaussian, or the centroid time of the earthquake. The start time of the simulation is \(t=-1.5*\texttt{half duration}\) (the 1.5 is to make sure the moment rate function is very close to zero when starting the simulation). To convert to absolute time \(t_{\mathrm{abs}}\), set

    \(t_{\mathrm{abs}}=t_{\mathrm{pde}}+\texttt{time shift}+t_{\mathrm{synthetic}}\)

    where \(t_{\mathrm{pde}}\) is the time given in the first line of the `CMTSOLUTION`, `time shift` is the corresponding value from the original `CMTSOLUTION` file and \(t_{\mathrm{synthetic}}\) is the time in the first column of the output seismogram.

If you know the earthquake source in strike/dip/rake format rather than in `CMTSOLUTION` format, use the C code `utils/strike_dip_rake_to_CMTSOLUTION.c` to convert it. The conversion formulas are given for instance in Aki and Richards (1980). Note that the Aki and Richards (1980) convention is slightly different from the Harvard `CMTSOLUTION` convention (the sign of some components is different). The C code outputs both.

Centroid latitude and longitude should be provided in geographical coordinates. The code converts these coordinates to geocentric coordinates (Dahlen and Tromp 1998). Of course you may provide your own source representations by designing your own `CMTSOLUTION` file. Just make sure that the resulting file adheres to the Harvard CMT conventions (see Appendix [cha:Reference-Frame-Convention]). Note that the first line in the `CMTSOLUTION` file is the Preliminary Determination of Earthquakes (PDE) solution performed by the USGS NEIC, which is used as a seed for the Harvard CMT inversion. The PDE solution is based upon P waves and often gives the hypocenter of the earthquake, i.e., the rupture initiation point, whereas the CMT solution gives the ‘centroid location’, which is the location with dominant moment release. The PDE solution is not used by our software package but must be present anyway in the first line of the file.

In the current version of the code, the solver can run with a non-zero `time shift` in the `CMTSOLUTION` file. Thus one does not need to set `time shift` to zero as it was the case for previous versions of the code. `time shift` is only used for writing centroid time in the SAC headers (see Appendix [cha:SAC-headers]). CMT time is obtained by adding `time shift` to the PDE time given in the first line in the `CMTSOLUTION` file. Therefore it is recommended not to modify `time shift` to have the correct timing information in the SAC headers without any post-processing of seismograms.

[To-simulate-a]To simulate a kinematic rupture, i.e., a finite-source event, represented in terms of \(N_{\mathrm{sources}}\) point sources, provide a `CMTSOLUTION` file that has \(N_{\mathrm{sources}}\) entries, one for each subevent (i.e., concatenate \(N_{\mathrm{sources}}\) `CMTSOLUTION` files to a single `CMTSOLUTION` file). At least one entry (not necessarily the first) must have a zero `time shift`, and all the other entries must have non-negative `time shift`. If none of the entries has a zero `time shift` in the `CMTSOLUTION` file, the smallest `time shift` is subtracted from all sources to initiate the simulation. Each subevent can have its own half duration, latitude, longitude, depth, and moment tensor (effectively, the local moment-density tensor).

Note that the zero in the synthetics does NOT represent the hypocentral time or centroid time in general, but the timing of the *center* of the source triangle with zero `time shift` (Fig [fig:source<sub>t</sub>iming]).

Although it is convenient to think of each source as a triangle, in the simulation they are actually Gaussians (as they have better frequency characteristics). The relationship between the triangle and the Gaussian used is shown in Fig [fig:gauss.vs.triangle]. For finite fault simulations it is usually not advisable to use a zero half duration and convolve afterwards, since the half duration is generally fixed by the finite fault model.

The `FORCESOLUTION` file should be edited in the following way:

-   The first line is only the header for the force solution, which can be used as the identifier for the force source.

-   `time shift:` For a single force source, set this parameter equal to \(0.0\) (The solver will not run otherwise!); the time shift parameter would simply apply an overall time shift to the synthetics, something that can be done in the post-processing (see Section [sec:Process-data-and-syn]).

-   `half duration:` Set the half duration value (s) for Step source time function. In case that the solver uses a (pseudo) Dirac delta source time function to represent a force point source, a very short duration of five time steps is automatically set by default. For a Ricker source time function, set the dominant frequency value (Hz). See the parameter `source time function:` below for source time functions.

-   `latitude:` Set the latitude of the force source.

-   `longitude:` Set the longitude of the force source.

-   `depth:` Set the depth of the force source (km).

-   `source time function:` Set the type of source time function. 0 = Step function, 1= Ricker function.

-   `factor force source:` Set the magnitude of the force source.

-   `component dir vect source E:` Set the East component of a direction vector for the force source. Direction vector is not necessarily a unit vector.

-   `component dir vect source N:` Set the North component of a direction vector for the force source.

-   `component dir vect source Z_up:` Set the vertical component of a direction vector for the force source. Sign convnetion follows the positive upward drection.

Where necessary, set a `FORCESOLUTION` file in the same way you configure a `CMTSOLUTION` file with \(N_{\mathrm{sources}}\) entries, one for each subevent (i.e., concatenate \(N_{\mathrm{sources}}\) `FORCESOLUTION` files to a single `FORCESOLUTION` file). At least one entry (not necessarily the first) must have a zero `time shift`, and all the other entries must have non-negative `time shift`. Each subevent can have its own set of parameters `latitude`, `longitude`, `depth:`, `half duration`, etc.

![Example of timing for three sources. The center of the first source triangle is defined to be time zero. Note that this is NOT in general the hypocentral time, or the start time of the source (marked as tstart). The parameter `time shift` in the `CMTSOLUTION` file would be t1(=0), t2, t3 in this case, and the parameter `half duration` would be hdur1, hdur2, hdur3 for the sources 1, 2, 3 respectively.<span data-label="fig:sourcetiming"></span>](figures/source_timing.pdf)

The solver can calculate seismograms at any number of stations for basically the same numerical cost, so the user is encouraged to include as many stations as conceivably useful in the `STATIONS` file, which looks like this:

![Sample `STATIONS` file. Station latitude and longitude should be provided in geographical coordinates. The width of the station label should be no more than 32 characters (see `MAX_LENGTH_STATION_NAME` in the `constants.h` file), and the network label should be no more than 8 characters (see `MAX_LENGTH_NETWORK_NAME` in the `constants.h` file).](figures/STATIONS_global_explained.pdf)
<div class="figcaption" style="text-align:justify;font-size:80%"><span style="color:#9A9A9A">Figure: Sample `STATIONS` file. Station latitude and longitude should be provided in geographical coordinates. The width of the station label should be no more than 32 characters (see `MAX_LENGTH_STATION_NAME` in the `constants.h` file), and the network label should be no more than 8 characters (see `MAX_LENGTH_NETWORK_NAME` in the `constants.h` file).</span></div>

Each line represents one station in the following format:

    Station Network Latitude(degrees) Longitude(degrees) Elevation(m) burial(m)

If you want to put a station on the ocean floor, just set elevation and burial depth in the STATIONS file to 0. Equivalently you can also set elevation to a negative value equal to the ocean depth, and burial depth to 0.

Solver output is provided in the `OUTPUT_FILES` directory in the `output_solver.txt` file. Output can be directed to the screen instead by uncommenting a line in `constants.h`:

    ! uncomment this to write messages to the screen
    ! integer, parameter :: IMAIN = ISTANDARD_OUTPUT

Note that on very fast machines, writing to the screen may slow down the code.

While the solver is running, its progress may be tracked by monitoring the ‘`timestamp*`’ files in the `OUTPUT_FILES` directory. These tiny files look something like this:

    Time step #           200
    Time:    0.6956667      minutes
    Elapsed time in seconds =     252.6748970000000
    Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =    0 h 04 m 12 s
    Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =     1.263374485000000
    Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m) =    1.9325
    Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices = 1.1058885E-22

The `timestamp*` files provide the `Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds`, which may be used to assess performance on various machines (assuming you are the only user on a node), as well as the `Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices (m)` and `Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices`. If something is wrong with the model, the mesh, or the source, you will see the code become unstable through exponentionally growing values of the displacement and/or fluid potential with time, and ultimately the run will be terminated by the program when either of these values becomes greater than `STABILITY_THRESHOLD` defined in `constants.h`. You can control the rate at which the timestamp files are written based upon the parameter `NTSTEP_BETWEEN_OUTPUT_INFO` in the `Par_file`.

Having set the `Par_file` parameters, and having provided the `CMTSOLUTION` and `STATIONS` files, you are now ready to launch the solver! This is most easily accomplished based upon the `go_solver` script (see Chapter [cha:Running-Scheduler] for information about running the code through a scheduler, e.g., LSF). You may need to edit the last command at the end of the script that invokes the `mpirun` command. Another option is to use the `runall` script, which compiles and runs both mesher and solver in sequence. This is a safe approach that ensures using the correct combination of mesher output and solver input.

It is important to realize that the CPU and memory requirements of the solver are closely tied to choices about attenuation (`ATTENUATION`) and the nature of the model (i.e., isotropic models are cheaper than anisotropic models). We encourage you to run a variety of simulations with various flags turned on or off to develop a sense for what is involved.

For the same model, one can rerun the solver for different events by simply changing the `CMTSOLUTION` file, and/or for different stations by changing the `STATIONS` file. There is no need to rerun the mesher. Of course it is best to include as many stations as possible, since this does not add significantly to the cost of the simulation.

Note on the simultaneous simulation of several earthquakes
----------------------------------------------------------

![ Directory structure when simulating several earthquakes at once. To improve readability, only directories have been drawn.<span data-label="fig:simultaneousdirstruct"></span>](figures/simultaneous_dir_struct.pdf)
<div class="figcaption" style="text-align:justify;font-size:80%"><span style="color:#9A9A9A">Figure:  Directory structure when simulating several earthquakes at once. To improve readability, only directories have been drawn.<span data-label="fig:simultaneousdirstruct"></span></span></div>

Figure [fig:simultaneous<sub>d</sub>ir<sub>s</sub>truct] shows what the directory structure should looks like when simulating multiple earthquakes at ones.

-   The simulation is launched within the root directory `EXAMPLE_ROOT_DIR`
    (usually `mpirun -np N ./bin/xspecfem3D`).

-   `DATA` should contain the `Par_file` parameter file with `NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS` as explained in Chapter [cha:Running-the-Mesher].

-   `DATABASES_MPI` and <span>OUTPUT\_FILES</span> directory may contain the mesher output but they are not required as they are superseded by the ones in the `runXXX` directories.

-   `runXXXX` directories must be created beforehand. There should be be as many as `NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS` and the numbering should be contiguous, starting from `0001`. They all should have `DATA`, `DATABASES_MPI` and `OUTPUT_FILES` directories. Additionally a `SEM` directory containing adjoint sources have to be created to perform adjoint simulations.

-   `runXXXX/DATA` directories must all contain a `CMTSOLUTION` file, a `STATIONS` file along with an eventual `STATIONS_ADJOINT` file.

-   If `BROADCAST_SAME_MESH_AND_MODEL` is set to `.true.` in `DATA/Par_file`, only `run0001/OUTPUT_FILES` and `run0001/DATABASES_MPI` directories need to contain the files outputted by the mesher.

-   If `BROADCAST_SAME_MESH_AND_MODEL` is set to `.false.` in `DATA/Par_file`, every `runXXXX/OUTPUT_FILES` and `runXXXX/DATABASES_MPI` directories need to contain the files outputted by the mesher. Note that while the meshes might have been created from different models and parameter sets, they should have been created using the same number of MPI processes.
